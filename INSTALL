THESE INSTRUCTIONS apply to Linux (Unix) computers. There will be a similar
guide for Windows once I get hold of one.

REQUIREMENTS

GNU C++ compiler:        g++
GNU make:	         make
Qt make:                 qmake
Qt libraries:            libqt5widgets libqt5gui libqt5network libqt5core
Open graphical library:  libgl
Portable thread library: libpthread 
Curl library:            libcurl-gnutls-dev or libcurl-openssl-dev
                         (the dev version is required because we need the curl
			  headers)

Depending on the Linux distribution the libraries may have slightly
different names, e.g. in Lubuntu it is libqt5widgets5, etc. You can
search for a particular library with the following command:

  apt search libqt5widgets

My Lubuntu environment would not do qmake before I did the following:

  sudo apt-get install qt5-default

To compile, invoke the following commands:

  qmake
  make

If the compiler complains about missing setTableTracking then your
version of QT is less than 5.9. You can edit out the corresponding line in
"mainwindow.ui".

To run the program you type:

  ./eggeinq &

To install, invoke the following:

  make install

or

  sudo make install (where necessary)

(By default, installation is to /opt/eggeinq which can be changed by
modifying target.path in file eggeinq.pro.) You need to make the
apropriate changes to the PATH.

To uninstall:

  [sudo] make uninstall
